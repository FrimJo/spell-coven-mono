# This project uses Conda environment files as the single source of truth for dependencies and versions.
# Please create one of the following environments instead of using requirements.txt:
#   - environment-cpu.yml   (portable CPU)
#   - environment-gpu.yml   (NVIDIA CUDA)
#   - environment-mps.yml   (Apple Silicon MPS)
#
# Example:
#   conda env create -f environment-cpu.yml
#   conda activate mtg-faiss-cpu
#
# If you still prefer pip-only installation, consult SPEC.md/README.md and
# assemble packages manually for your platform. Note that GPU/MPS setups are
# more reliable with Conda (PyTorch and FAISS).
