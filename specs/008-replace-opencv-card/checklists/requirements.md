# Specification Quality Checklist: Replace OpenCV Card Detection with DETR

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-15  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Notes

**Content Quality**: ✅ PASS
- Specification focuses on WHAT users need (reliable card detection, fast loading, accurate filtering)
- Written in business terms without technical implementation details
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

**Requirement Completeness**: ✅ PASS
- All 12 functional requirements are testable and unambiguous
- Success criteria include specific metrics (30% accuracy improvement, 50% false positive reduction, 15 FPS)
- Edge cases comprehensively cover failure scenarios
- Assumptions clearly document prerequisites and constraints

**Feature Readiness**: ✅ PASS
- Each user story has clear acceptance scenarios with Given/When/Then format
- Three prioritized user stories (P1, P2, P3) provide independent test slices
- Success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic
- Scope is well-bounded to detection replacement without affecting identification pipeline

**Overall Status**: ✅ READY FOR PLANNING

The specification is complete, clear, and ready to proceed to `/speckit.plan` or `/speckit.clarify` if needed.
