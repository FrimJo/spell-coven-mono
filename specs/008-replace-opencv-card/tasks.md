# Tasks: Replace OpenCV Card Detection with DETR

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/008-replace-opencv-card/`  
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md

**Tests**: Tests are OPTIONAL per constitution - not included unless explicitly requested

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Monorepo web app**: `apps/web/src/`, `apps/web/tests/`
- All changes isolated to `apps/web` package
- Primary modification: `apps/web/src/lib/webcam.ts`

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Verify environment and prepare for DETR integration

- [x] T001 Verify @huggingface/transformers ^3.7.5 is installed in apps/web/package.json
- [x] T002 [P] Run type checking to establish baseline (pnpm check-types from apps/web)
- [x] T003 [P] Run linting to establish baseline (pnpm lint from apps/web)
- [x] T004 [P] Review existing webcam.ts to understand OpenCV detection logic in apps/web/src/lib/webcam.ts

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [x] T005 Add DETR detection types to apps/web/src/types/card-query.ts (DetectionResult, BoundingBox, DetectedCard interfaces)
- [x] T006 Create detection constants module in apps/web/src/lib/detection-constants.ts (confidence threshold, aspect ratio, intervals)
- [x] T007 Add DETR pipeline initialization function in apps/web/src/lib/webcam.ts (loadDetector with progress callbacks)
- [x] T008 Add detection state management in apps/web/src/lib/webcam.ts (detector variable, loading status, error handling)

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Reliable Card Detection in Varied Lighting (Priority: P1) 🎯 MVP

**Goal**: Replace OpenCV edge detection with DETR object detection to improve accuracy in varied lighting and reduce false positives

- [x] T038 [US2] Manual test: Verify status messages are clear and informative (console logs show clear status)

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Stories 1 AND 2 should both work - detection works with good UX

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Accurate Aspect Ratio Filtering (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Fine-tune aspect ratio filtering to minimize false positives from non-card rectangular objects

**Independent Test**: Place various rectangular objects (phone, book, credit card) alongside MTG cards and verify only cards are detected

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-5)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 → P2 → P3)
- **Polish (Phase 6)**: Depends on all user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Builds on US1 but independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Refines US1 filtering but independently testable

### Within Each User Story

- Remove old code before adding new code (clean slate)
- Core detection logic before rendering
- Filtering logic before integration
- Type checking and linting after implementation
- Manual testing after code changes
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- T002, T003, T004 in Phase 1 can run in parallel
- T005, T006 in Phase 2 can run in parallel (different files)
- T012, T013 in US1 can run in parallel (independent functions)
- T027, T028 in US2 can run in parallel (independent functions)
- T039, T040 in US3 can run in parallel (independent functions)
- T052, T053, T054, T055 in Polish phase can run in parallel (different concerns)
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members after Phase 2

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# After T011 completes, launch these together:
Task T012: "Implement aspect ratio validation function"
Task T013: "Implement bounding box to polygon conversion"

# Both work on different functions in same file, no conflicts
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (verify environment)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - adds types and initialization)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (core DETR detection)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test detection with real webcam in various conditions
5. Deploy/demo if ready - this alone provides value

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 → Test independently → **Deploy/Demo (MVP!)** - Core detection works
3. Add User Story 2 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo - Better UX with progress
4. Add User Story 3 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo - Higher precision
5. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together (4 tasks, ~1 hour)
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (T009-T026, ~4-6 hours)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (T027-T038, ~2-3 hours) - can start in parallel
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (T039-T051, ~1-2 hours) - can start in parallel
3. Stories complete and integrate independently
4. Team reconvenes for Polish phase

- **Phase 6 (Polish)**: 14 tasks 🔄 IN PROGRESS

**Parallel Opportunities**: 15 tasks marked [P] can run in parallel with others

**Estimated Time**:
- MVP (Setup + Foundational + US1): 6-8 hours
- Full feature (all user stories): 12-16 hours
- With parallel execution: 8-12 hours

**Suggested MVP Scope**: Phase 1 + Phase 2 + Phase 3 (User Story 1 only)
- Delivers core value: Improved card detection accuracy
- Independently testable and deployable
- Foundation for P2 and P3 enhancements

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files or independent functions, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- All changes isolated to `apps/web/src/lib/webcam.ts` (primary) and supporting files
- No breaking changes to CLIP identification pipeline
- Constitution compliance: Browser-first, no backend dependencies, performance optimized
