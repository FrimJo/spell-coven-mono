# Tasks: MTG Image Database and Frontend Integration

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/010-ensure-mtg-image/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Tests are OPTIONAL per constitution. E2E tests using mocked webcam stream requested in spec.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Monorepo structure**: `apps/web/src/`, `packages/mtg-image-db/`
- Frontend: TypeScript/React in `apps/web/`
- Backend: Python in `packages/mtg-image-db/`

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-5)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3)
- **Polish (Phase 6)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Depends on US1 for data loading but should be independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Depends on US2 for embedding logic but should be independently testable

### Within Each User Story

- Validation/loading modules before detection/embedding
- Detection before embedding
- Embedding before search
- Search before UI display
- Core implementation before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- **Setup**: T003 and T004 can run in parallel
- **Foundational**: T006 and T007 can run in parallel
- **User Story 1**: T011-T015 (all validation functions) can run in parallel
- **User Story 2**: T025 (SlimSAM), T036 (CLIP), T040 (search), T043 (UI) can start in parallel after foundational
- **User Story 3**: T052 (Python test) and T055 (browser test) can run in parallel
- **Polish**: All tasks marked [P] can run in parallel

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all validation functions together:
Task: "Implement file size validation (FR-001) in apps/web/src/lib/validation/contract-validator.ts"
Task: "Implement version validation (FR-002) in apps/web/src/lib/validation/contract-validator.ts"
Task: "Implement record count validation (FR-003) in apps/web/src/lib/validation/contract-validator.ts"
Task: "Implement dtype and scale factor validation in apps/web/src/lib/validation/contract-validator.ts"
Task: "Implement required fields validation (FR-014) in apps/web/src/lib/validation/contract-validator.ts"
```

## Parallel Example: User Story 2

```bash
# Launch all module skeletons together:
Task: "Create SlimSAMDetector class skeleton in apps/web/src/lib/detectors/slimsam-detector.ts"
Task: "Create CLIP embedder module in apps/web/src/lib/search/clip-embedder.ts"
Task: "Create similarity search module in apps/web/src/lib/search/similarity-search.ts"
Task: "Create CardIdentificationResult component in apps/web/src/components/CardIdentificationResult.tsx"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T004)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T005-T010) - CRITICAL - blocks all stories
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (T011-T024)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test data contract validation independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready

**MVP Deliverable**: Data contract validation ensures artifacts are correctly formatted and loaded

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Full card identification!)
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Compatibility verified!)
5. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together (T001-T010)
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (T011-T024) - Data validation
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (T025-T051) - Card identification
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (T052-T060) - Compatibility testing
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

## Task Summary

- **Total Tasks**: 74
- **Setup Phase**: 4 tasks
- **Foundational Phase**: 6 tasks (BLOCKING)
- **User Story 1 (P1)**: 14 tasks - Data Contract Validation
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: 27 tasks - End-to-End Card Identification
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: 9 tasks - Embedding Compatibility
- **Polish Phase**: 14 tasks

**Parallel Opportunities**: 35 tasks marked [P] can run in parallel within their phase

**Independent Test Criteria**:
- US1: Load artifacts, verify all validations pass/fail correctly
- US2: Click card in webcam, get correct identification in <3s
- US3: Same image embedded in Python and browser has >0.99 similarity

**Suggested MVP Scope**: Phase 1 + Phase 2 + Phase 3 (User Story 1 only) = 24 tasks

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies within phase
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Run `pnpm check-types` and `pnpm lint` frequently per constitution
- Use Context7 (`mcp1_resolve-library-id` and `mcp1_get-library-docs`) for up-to-date npm package documentation
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
