# Specification Quality Checklist: MTG Image Database and Frontend Integration

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-16  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

All checklist items pass. The specification is complete and ready for planning phase (`/speckit.plan`).

**Key Strengths**:
- Clear data contract validation requirements with specific error handling
- Well-defined end-to-end integration flow from webcam to search results
- Measurable success criteria with specific thresholds (e.g., >0.99 cosine similarity, <3 second response time)
- Comprehensive edge case coverage for data format mismatches and runtime failures
- Technology-agnostic requirements focusing on WHAT needs to happen, not HOW

**Dependencies Identified**:
- mtg-image-db package must export int8-quantized embeddings with version 1.0 metadata format
- Frontend must use same CLIP model (`Xenova/clip-vit-base-patch32`) as Python export
- SlimSAM and CLIP must both support WebGPU/WebGL/WASM fallback chain
- Card aspect ratio constant (1.4) must be consistent across extraction and database generation
