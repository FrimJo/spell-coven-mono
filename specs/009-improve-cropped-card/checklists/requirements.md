# Specification Quality Checklist: Improve Cropped Card Query Accuracy

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-16
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality - PASS ✅
- Specification focuses on preprocessing pipeline alignment and accuracy improvements
- Written in terms of user outcomes (accurate card identification) rather than technical implementation
- Avoids specific code, frameworks, or implementation details
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

### Requirement Completeness - PASS ✅
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present
- All 10 functional requirements are testable and specific
- Success criteria include measurable percentages and thresholds (30% improvement, 0.95 similarity score, etc.)
- Success criteria are technology-agnostic (focus on accuracy, consistency, performance)
- Acceptance scenarios use Given-When-Then format with clear conditions
- Edge cases cover foiled cards, double-faced cards, foreign cards, missing cards, and altered art
- Scope is bounded to preprocessing pipeline fixes
- Assumptions clearly documented (384×384 resolution, CLIP model consistency, etc.)

### Feature Readiness - PASS ✅
- Each functional requirement maps to acceptance scenarios in user stories
- User stories prioritized (P1: core accuracy, P2: consistency, P3: feedback)
- Each user story is independently testable
- Success criteria directly measure the feature goals (accuracy improvement)
- No implementation leakage detected

## Notes

All checklist items passed validation. The specification is ready for the next phase (`/speckit.plan`).

**Key Strengths**:
- Clear problem statement with measurable baseline requirements
- Well-structured user stories with realistic acceptance criteria
- Comprehensive edge case coverage
- Technology-agnostic success criteria with specific thresholds

**Recommendations for Planning Phase**:
- Establish baseline measurements before implementation begins
- Create test dataset of 100 diverse cards for accuracy validation
- Consider creating visual documentation of preprocessing pipeline differences
