# Specification Quality Checklist: Integrate Figma-Exported Vite App into Monorepo

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: October 14, 2025  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality Assessment
✅ **PASS** - The specification focuses on WHAT and WHY without specifying HOW:
- Describes user needs (developers need to run, preview, validate)
- Focuses on outcomes (standalone app, consistent tooling, reusable components)
- Avoids implementation specifics (mentions tools by name as requirements, not implementation)

### Requirement Completeness Assessment
✅ **PASS** - All requirements are clear and testable:
- No clarification markers present
- Each FR is specific and verifiable
- Success criteria include measurable metrics (10 seconds, no errors, no warnings)
- Acceptance scenarios follow Given-When-Then format
- Edge cases address key integration concerns

### Feature Readiness Assessment
✅ **PASS** - Feature is ready for planning phase:
- Three prioritized user stories with independent test criteria
- Clear acceptance scenarios for each story
- Measurable success criteria defined
- Scope is bounded to integration concerns

## Notes

**Specification Quality**: Excellent - This specification successfully maintains the boundary between requirements and implementation. While it mentions specific tools (TypeScript, Tailwind, ESLint, Prettier), these are treated as integration requirements rather than implementation details, which is appropriate for a monorepo integration feature.

**Ready for Next Phase**: ✅ This specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` or `/speckit.clarify` (if additional questions arise during planning).
