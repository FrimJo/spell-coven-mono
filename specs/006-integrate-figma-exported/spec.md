# Feature Specification: Integrate Figma-Exported Vite App into Monorepo

**Feature Branch**: `006-integrate-figma-exported`  
**Created**: October 14, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Integrate Figma-exported Vite app into monorepo with shared tooling and component library"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Run Figma Export as Standalone App (Priority: P1)

Developers need to run the Figma-exported design as a standalone application within the monorepo to preview and validate the latest design updates from the design team.

**Why this priority**: This is the core deliverable - enabling the Figma export to function independently while integrated into the monorepo structure. Without this, designers cannot share updated designs with the development team for review and validation.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running the dev server for the figma_export app and verifying it loads without errors, displays all UI components correctly, and responds to user interactions as designed.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the monorepo is set up, **When** a developer runs the dev command for figma_export, **Then** the application starts successfully on its designated port
2. **Given** the figma_export app is running, **When** a developer navigates through different pages/components, **Then** all UI elements render correctly with proper styling
3. **Given** the figma_export app is running, **When** a developer interacts with UI components, **Then** all interactive elements respond appropriately

---

### User Story 2 - Consistent Tooling Across Apps (Priority: P2)

Developers need the figma_export app to use the same linting, formatting, type checking, and styling tools as the main web app to maintain code quality standards and reduce context switching.

**Why this priority**: Ensures development consistency and prevents tooling conflicts. Developers should not need to remember different configurations for different apps in the same monorepo.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by running lint, format check, and type check commands on figma_export and verifying they use the same rules as apps/web, with no configuration conflicts.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the figma_export app is configured, **When** a developer runs the lint command, **Then** it uses the shared ESLint configuration and reports issues consistently with other apps
2. **Given** the figma_export app is configured, **When** a developer runs the format check command, **Then** it uses the shared Prettier configuration
3. **Given** the figma_export app is configured, **When** a developer runs the type check command, **Then** it uses the shared TypeScript configuration
4. **Given** the figma_export app uses styling, **When** styles are applied, **Then** they use the shared Tailwind configuration

---

### User Story 3 - Reusable Component Library (Priority: P3)

Developers need common UI components from the Figma export to be available in the shared component library so they can be reused across both the figma_export preview app and the main web application.

**Why this priority**: Promotes code reuse and design consistency. Once validated in the preview app, components can be easily adopted in the production application without duplication.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by identifying common components in figma_export, moving them to packages/ui, and verifying they can be imported and used in both figma_export and apps/web.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** common components exist in figma_export, **When** they are moved to packages/ui, **Then** they can be imported successfully in both apps
2. **Given** a component is in packages/ui, **When** it is used in figma_export, **Then** it renders identically to its original implementation
3. **Given** a component is in packages/ui, **When** it is used in apps/web, **Then** it integrates seamlessly with existing components

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the figma_export app has dependencies that conflict with existing monorepo packages?
- How does the system handle components that exist in both figma_export and packages/ui with different implementations?
- What happens when Tailwind v4 configuration differs from the previous Tailwind v3 setup?
- How are theme-related components (dark mode, theme switching) handled when they need to be removed?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The figma_export app MUST run as a standalone application with its own dev server
- **FR-002**: The figma_export app MUST use the shared TypeScript configuration from packages/typescript-config
- **FR-003**: The figma_export app MUST use the shared Tailwind configuration from packages/tailwind
- **FR-004**: The figma_export app MUST use the shared Prettier configuration from packages/prettier
- **FR-005**: The figma_export app MUST use the shared ESLint configuration from packages/eslint-config
- **FR-006**: The figma_export app MUST use Tailwind CSS v4 for styling
- **FR-007**: Common UI components MUST be moved to or created in packages/ui
- **FR-008**: Components in packages/ui MUST be importable by both figma_export and apps/web
- **FR-009**: Dark mode and theme switching functionality MUST be removed from the figma_export app
- **FR-010**: The figma_export app MUST follow the same project structure patterns as apps/web
- **FR-011**: All tooling commands (lint, format, type-check) MUST work correctly in figma_export
- **FR-012**: The figma_export app MUST build successfully for production

### Key Entities

- **Figma Export App**: A Vite-based React application containing the latest design exported from Figma, serving as a preview environment for design validation
- **Shared Tooling Packages**: Monorepo packages (typescript-config, tailwind, prettier, eslint-config) that provide consistent development tooling across all applications
- **UI Component Library**: A shared package containing reusable React components that can be used across multiple applications in the monorepo
- **Monorepo Workspace**: The parent repository structure that manages multiple applications and packages with shared dependencies

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Developers can start the figma_export app with a single command and see the UI within 10 seconds
- **SC-002**: All linting, formatting, and type checking commands execute without errors in figma_export
- **SC-003**: The figma_export app builds successfully for production without warnings
- **SC-004**: Common components can be imported from packages/ui in both figma_export and apps/web without modification
- **SC-005**: The figma_export app uses Tailwind v4 and renders all styles correctly
- **SC-006**: No dark mode or theme switching UI elements remain in the figma_export app
