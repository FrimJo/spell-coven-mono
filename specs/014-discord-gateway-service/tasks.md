# Tasks: Discord Gateway Service

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/014-discord-gateway-service/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Tests are NOT included in this task list as they were not explicitly requested in the feature specification.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Gateway Worker**: `packages/discord-gateway-worker/src/`
- **TanStack Start Backend**: `apps/web/app/`
- **Client Libraries**: `packages/discord-integration/src/`

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-7)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - US1, US2, US3 are P1 priority (MVP scope)
  - US4, US5 are P2 priority (can be done after MVP)
  - User stories can proceed in parallel if staffed
- **Internal Events (Phase 8)**: Can be done in parallel with user stories (cross-cutting)
- **Polish (Phase 9)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent of US1 but complements it
- **User Story 3 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent of US1/US2
- **User Story 4 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent library implementation
- **User Story 5 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent library implementation
- **Internal Events (Phase 8)**: Required for US3 to work end-to-end, but can be implemented in parallel

### Within Each User Story

- Schemas before route implementations
- Route implementations before event forwarding
- Core implementation before error handling and logging
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- Schemas within a story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members
- Polish tasks marked [P] can run in parallel

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch schemas together:
Task: "Create CreateRoomRequest schema with Zod in apps/web/app/server/schemas.ts"
Task: "Create CreateRoomResponse schema with Zod in apps/web/app/server/schemas.ts"

# Then implement route (depends on schemas):
Task: "Implement POST /api/create-room route in apps/web/app/routes/api/create-room.ts"
```

## Parallel Example: User Story 5

```bash
# Launch type definitions together:
Task: "Create types for RTC connection state in packages/discord-integration/src/types/rtc-types.ts"
Task: "Create types for media streams (audio/video) in packages/discord-integration/src/types/rtc-types.ts"

# Then implement client methods in parallel:
Task: "Implement sendAudio(stream) method with Opus codec (48kHz)"
Task: "Implement sendVideo(stream) method with VP8 codec (primary)"
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Stories 1, 2, 3 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (Create rooms)
4. Complete Phase 4: User Story 2 (Delete rooms)
5. Complete Phase 5: User Story 3 (Real-time events)
6. Complete Phase 8: Internal Events (Required for US3)
7. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test all three user stories independently
8. Deploy/demo if ready

**MVP Scope**: 104 tasks (T001-T052, T084-T090, T091-T104)

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Basic room creation)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Full room lifecycle)
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Real-time events - MVP complete!)
5. Add User Story 4 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (REST client library)
6. Add User Story 5 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (RTC client library with video)
7. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Create rooms)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (Delete rooms)
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (Real-time events)
   - Developer D: User Story 4 (REST client)
   - Developer E: User Story 5 (RTC client)
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Gateway Worker must be deployed separately from TanStack Start
- Bot token MUST never be exposed to browser
- HMAC signatures MUST be verified for all internal events
- WebSocket clients MUST implement auto-reconnect with exponential backoff
- Video codec priority: VP8 (primary), VP9/H.264 (fallbacks)
- Audio codec: Opus @ 48kHz (Discord standard)
