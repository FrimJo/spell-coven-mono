# Specification Quality Checklist: Card Cropping and Image Database Query Integration

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-15  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

All checklist items passed. The specification is complete and ready for planning phase.

### Validation Details:

**Content Quality**: ✅
- Spec focuses on WHAT users need (card identification during gameplay) without specifying HOW to implement
- No framework-specific details (React, TypeScript, etc.) in requirements
- Written in plain language accessible to product managers and stakeholders
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are present and complete

**Requirement Completeness**: ✅
- All requirements are concrete and testable (e.g., "display result below player list", "446x620 pixels")
- No ambiguous [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present
- Success criteria are measurable (e.g., "within 3 seconds", "95% of valid detections")
- Success criteria avoid implementation details (no mention of specific libraries or code structure)
- Edge cases comprehensively cover failure scenarios
- Scope is bounded to card cropping and query integration (excludes OCR, multi-modal search, etc.)

**Feature Readiness**: ✅
- Each functional requirement maps to user scenarios and success criteria
- Three prioritized user stories cover core functionality (P1), debugging (P2), and error handling (P3)
- Each user story is independently testable and deliverable
- Specification maintains technology-agnostic language throughout
