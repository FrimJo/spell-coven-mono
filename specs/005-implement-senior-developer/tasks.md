# Tasks: MTG Image DB Production Hardening

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/005-implement-senior-developer/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/cli-interface.md

**Tests**: No automated tests required per specification. Manual testing scenarios provided in quickstart.md.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- All changes in `packages/mtg-image-db/`
- This is in-place hardening of existing Python scripts
- No new directory structure needed

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-9)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - US1, US2, US3, US6 are P1 (critical) - should be done first
  - US4, US5 are P2 (important) - can be done in parallel with P1 or after
  - US7 is P3 (nice-to-have) - can be done last
- **Polish (Phase 10)**: Depends on all user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **US1 (Reliable Downloads)**: Can start after Foundational - No dependencies on other stories
- **US2 (Data Validation)**: Can start after Foundational - Independent of US1 but logically follows
- **US3 (Edge Cases)**: Can start after Foundational - Independent of US1/US2
- **US4 (Parallel Processing)**: Depends on US1 (uses same download infrastructure)
- **US5 (Configurable HNSW)**: Can start after Foundational - Independent of all others
- **US6 (Correct Metrics)**: Foundational phase includes the core fix - this phase adds verification
- **US7 (Checkpointing)**: Can start after Foundational - Independent of all others

### Within Each User Story

- Helper modules (Phase 1) before user story implementations
- Foundational fixes (Phase 2) before any user story work
- Within each story: utilities ‚Üí core implementation ‚Üí integration ‚Üí testing

### Parallel Opportunities

- **Phase 1**: All helper modules (T001-T004) can be created in parallel
- **Phase 2**: T005-T006 (import cleanup) can run in parallel; T007-T011 (correctness fixes) are sequential within same files
- **Phase 3 (US1)**: T013-T014 (session setup) can run in parallel; T016 and T020 are sequential (same file)
- **Phase 4 (US2)**: T021 (validation function) can run in parallel with T027 (standalone utility)
- **Phase 5 (US3)**: T029 (validation function) can run before T030-T032 (usage); T033-T037 are sequential within files
- **Phase 10**: All README updates (T063-T067) and docstrings (T068) can run in parallel

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1 (Reliable Downloads)

```bash
# These can run in parallel (different modules):
Task T013: "Create DownloadSession class in helpers/session.py"
Task T014: "Add User-Agent header to session in helpers/session.py"
Task T015: "Implement atomic file write in helpers/atomic_io.py"

# These must run sequentially (same file):
Task T016: "Update download_image() in build_mtg_faiss.py"
Task T020: "Update build_mtg_faiss.py download_image()"
```

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 2 (Data Validation)

```bash
# These can run in parallel (different files):
Task T021: "Implement validate_image() in helpers/validation.py"
Task T027: "Create standalone validation utility scripts/validate_cache.py"

# These must run sequentially (same file):
Task T022: "Add validation pass in build_embeddings.py"
Task T023: "Add validation logging in build_embeddings.py"
Task T024: "Update statistics in build_embeddings.py"
```

2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: US1 (Downloads) + US4 (Parallel)
   - Developer B: US2 (Validation)
   - Developer C: US3 (Edge Cases) + US5 (HNSW Config)
   - Developer D: US6 (Metrics) + US7 (Checkpointing)

**Suggested MVP Scope**: Phases 1-5 + Phase 8 (US1, US2, US3, US6) = 38 tasks (excludes optional T060a and T070a)

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently testable using quickstart.md scenarios
- No automated tests required - use manual testing procedures
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Focus on P1 stories first (US1, US2, US3, US6) for production readiness
