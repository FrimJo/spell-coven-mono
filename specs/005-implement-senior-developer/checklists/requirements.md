## Validation Results

### Content Quality Assessment

✅ **Pass** - The specification focuses on what the system must do (reliability, validation, performance) without prescribing specific implementations. While it mentions specific tools (FAISS, CLIP, Scryfall), these are existing components being hardened, not new implementation choices.

✅ **Pass** - All content emphasizes developer experience, data integrity, and system reliability—clear business value.

✅ **Pass** - The specification is written in terms of behaviors, outcomes, and user scenarios that non-technical stakeholders can understand. Technical terms are used appropriately for the domain.

✅ **Pass** - All mandatory sections (User Scenarios & Testing, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete with substantial detail.

### Requirement Completeness Assessment

✅ **Pass** - No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present. All requirements are fully specified based on the senior developer's detailed feedback.

✅ **Pass** - All 31 functional requirements are testable with clear acceptance criteria. Each can be verified through automated tests, manual inspection, or measurement.

✅ **Pass** - All 12 success criteria are measurable with specific metrics (percentages, performance ratios, error rates, timing thresholds).

✅ **Pass** - Success criteria focus on outcomes (completion rates, performance improvements, error handling) without specifying how to achieve them.

✅ **Pass** - Each of the 7 user stories includes detailed acceptance scenarios in Given-When-Then format.

✅ **Pass** - Comprehensive edge cases section covers 10 different failure scenarios with expected behaviors.

✅ **Pass** - Scope is clearly bounded to hardening the existing mtg-image-db package based on specific senior developer feedback. No scope creep into new features.

✅ **Pass** - Dependencies (existing CLIP embedder, FAISS library, Scryfall API) and assumptions (L2 normalization behavior, file system atomicity) are identified throughout requirements.

### Feature Readiness Assessment

✅ **Pass** - Each functional requirement maps to acceptance scenarios in the user stories. The relationship between requirements and test scenarios is clear.

✅ **Pass** - Seven prioritized user stories cover all major flows: downloads (P1), validation (P1), edge cases (P1), parallel processing (P2), configuration (P2), correctness (P1), and resumability (P3).

✅ **Pass** - The 12 success criteria directly measure the outcomes described in user stories and requirements (failure rates, performance improvements, correctness validation).

✅ **Pass** - The specification maintains abstraction throughout. Even when mentioning specific technologies, it focuses on behaviors and outcomes rather than implementation approaches.

## Notes

**Specification Quality**: Excellent. This specification demonstrates strong understanding of production system requirements. It translates detailed technical feedback into user-centric scenarios while maintaining testability.

**Key Strengths**:
- Comprehensive edge case coverage
- Clear prioritization (P1/P2/P3) enabling incremental delivery
- Measurable success criteria with specific thresholds
- Strong focus on correctness and data integrity
- Well-balanced between robustness and performance

**Ready for Next Phase**: This specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` to generate implementation design artifacts.

## Clarification Session: 2025-10-14

**Questions Resolved**: 3

1. **Retry Strategy**: Max 5 retries with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s) capped at 60s - provides balanced approach between respecting rate limits and completing downloads efficiently
2. **Checkpoint Frequency**: Every 500 images - balances recovery granularity (~2.5% max rework) with I/O overhead
3. **User-Agent Format**: Detailed format with repository link - follows API best practices and enables Scryfall to contact maintainers if needed

**Impact**: All clarifications integrated into functional requirements (FR-002, FR-003, FR-018) and acceptance scenarios. Specification now has complete implementation guidance for networking, checkpointing, and API etiquette.
