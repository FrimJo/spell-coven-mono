# Specification Quality Checklist: CLIP Model Alignment & Pipeline Optimization

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-17
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

**Validation Completed**: 2025-10-17

All checklist items now pass after removing the "Implementation Notes" section and simplifying technical language throughout the spec. Key changes made:

1. **Removed Implementation Details**: Deleted entire "Implementation Notes" section (145+ lines of code snippets, file paths, and technical instructions)
2. **Simplified Requirements**: Rewrote functional requirements to focus on "what" not "how" (e.g., "use same model as Python" instead of specific model IDs)
3. **User-Focused Success Criteria**: Changed from technical metrics (cosine similarity, dimensions) to user-observable outcomes (identical results, faster performance)
4. **Added Scope Sections**: Added "Assumptions" and "Out of Scope" sections to clearly bound the feature
5. **Simplified Key Entities**: Removed technical jargon (L2-normalization, float32, etc.) in favor of business concepts

The spec is now ready for `/speckit.plan` or `/speckit.clarify` if additional clarification is needed.
