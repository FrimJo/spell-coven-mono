# Tasks: CLIP Model Alignment & Pipeline Optimization

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/012-fix-clip-model-alignment/`  
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Manual visual inspection + embedding similarity validation (no automated test tasks per spec clarifications)

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Web app (monorepo)**: `apps/web/src/` for implementation
- All paths are absolute from repository root

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Verify environment and prepare for implementation

- [ ] T001 Verify TypeScript, React 19, and @huggingface/transformers 3.7.5 are installed in apps/web/package.json
- [ ] T002 [P] Run type checking to establish baseline: `pnpm check-types` from apps/web/
- [ ] T003 [P] Run linting to establish baseline: `pnpm lint` from apps/web/
- [ ] T004 Create backup of current CLIP implementation files (clip-embedder.ts, clip-search.ts, contract-validator.ts)

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [ ] T005 Update CLIP model configuration constant: Change model ID from 'Xenova/clip-vit-base-patch32' to 'Xenova/clip-vit-large-patch14-336' in apps/web/src/lib/search/clip-embedder.ts
- [ ] T006 [P] Update expected embedding dimension constant from 512 to 768 in apps/web/src/lib/search/clip-embedder.ts
- [ ] T007 [P] Update expected embedding dimension constant from 512 to 768 in apps/web/src/lib/validation/contract-validator.ts
- [ ] T008 [P] Update CROPPED_CARD_WIDTH and CROPPED_CARD_HEIGHT from 384 to 336 in apps/web/src/lib/detection-constants.ts
- [ ] T009 Update model ID from 'Xenova/clip-vit-base-patch32' to 'Xenova/clip-vit-large-patch14-336' in apps/web/src/lib/search/clip-search.ts (if separate implementation exists)
- [ ] T010 Run type checking to verify no type errors: `pnpm check-types` from apps/web/

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Correct Card Identification (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP

**Goal**: Fix dimension mismatch so browser generates 768-dim embeddings matching database format

**Independent Test**: 
1. Click a card in video stream
2. Open browser console and verify: "Embedding dimension: 768" (not 512)
3. Verify search completes without dimension mismatch errors
4. Compare with Python pipeline on same card image (should return identical top-1 match)

### Implementation for User Story 1

- [ ] T013 [P] [US1] Update error message in embedFromCanvas(): Change "512" to "768" and "ViT-B/32" to "ViT-L/14@336px" in apps/web/src/lib/search/clip-embedder.ts
- [ ] T014 [P] [US1] Update dimension validation error message in contract-validator.ts: Change expected dimension from 512 to 768 and update model reference to "ViT-L/14@336px"
- [ ] T015 [P] [US1] Update database dimension validation in contract-validator.ts: Change embeddingDim check from 512 to 768

- [ ] T018 [US1] Run type checking: `pnpm check-types` from apps/web/
- [ ] T019 [US1] Run linting: `pnpm lint` from apps/web/
- [ ] T020 [US1] Manual test: Click card, verify 768-dim embedding in console, confirm search completes successfully

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Story 1 should be fully functional - browser generates 768-dim embeddings matching database

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Consistent Preprocessing Pipeline (Priority: P1)

**Goal**: Ensure browser preprocessing matches Python pipeline (black padding, 336√ó336)

**Independent Test**:
1. Process same card image in Python and browser
2. Export preprocessed images from both
3. Visual inspection: Should be identical (black padding, 336√ó336)
4. Verify embedding similarity ‚â•0.95 between Python and browser

### Implementation for User Story 2

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Optimized Pipeline Without Redundant Operations (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Remove unnecessary 446√ó620 resize step between SlimSAM and CLIP

**Independent Test**:
1. Measure end-to-end latency from click to result (before and after)
2. Verify 446√ó620 canvas is no longer created (check code paths)
3. Confirm search results remain identical to previous pipeline

### Implementation for User Story 3

- [ ] T029 [P] [US3] Search for and identify any code creating 446√ó620 canvas between SlimSAM and CLIP in apps/web/src/
- [ ] T030 [US3] Remove or comment out 446√ó620 resize operation (if found) in identified file

**Checkpoint**: All P1, P2, and P3 user stories complete - lazy loading implemented

---

## Phase 7: User Story 5 - Clear Error Messages and Validation (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Provide clear, actionable error messages for dimension mismatches and failures

**Independent Test**:
1. Intentionally use mismatched database dimensions, verify clear error message
2. Test with corrupted embeddings, confirm validation catches issue

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-7)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - US1 (P1): Can start after Foundational - No dependencies on other stories
  - US2 (P1): Can start after Foundational - No dependencies on other stories (can run parallel with US1)
  - US3 (P2): Can start after Foundational - No dependencies on other stories (can run parallel with US1/US2)
  - US4 (P3): Depends on US1 completion (needs working embedding generation)
  - US5 (P2): Can start after Foundational - No dependencies on other stories (can run parallel with US1/US2/US3)
- **Polish (Phase 8)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent, can run parallel with US1
- **User Story 3 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent, can run parallel with US1/US2
- **User Story 4 (P3)**: Depends on US1 (needs working 768-dim embedding generation)
- **User Story 5 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent, can run parallel with US1/US2/US3

### Within Each User Story

- Tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- Type checking and linting tasks should run after implementation tasks
- Manual testing tasks should run after type checking and linting pass

- **Phase 3 (US1)**: T011, T012, T013, T014, T015 can run in parallel (different validation points in same/different files)
- **Phase 4 (US2)**: T021, T022, T023 can run in parallel (different files)
- **Phase 5 (US3)**: T029 and T032 can run in parallel
- **Phase 6 (US4)**: T037 and T038 can run in parallel (different methods)
- **Phase 7 (US5)**: T049, T050, T053, T054 can run in parallel (different validation points)
- **Phase 8**: T062, T063, T064, T065, T066 can run in parallel (different files)
- **User Stories**: US1, US2, US3, US5 can all run in parallel after Foundational phase (US4 depends on US1)

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files or independent changes, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Run type checking and linting frequently (after each phase)
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Manual testing required per spec clarifications (visual inspection + embedding similarity)
- Breaking change: Database must be regenerated with 768-dim embeddings before deployment
