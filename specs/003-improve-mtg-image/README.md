# Feature: MTG Image DB Quality Improvements

**Branch**: `003-improve-mtg-image`
**Status**: Specification Complete ✅
**Created**: 2025-10-13

## Overview

Comprehensive quality improvements for the `mtg-image-db` package covering observability, testing, code quality, configuration, documentation, and advanced developer workflows. 

**Migrated from**: `packages/mtg-image-db/IMPROVEMENTS.md` (now deleted)
- All Priority 3-9 improvements have been converted to SpecKit user stories
- Priority 1-2 improvements were already completed (see `specs/001-enable-mtg-players/`)
- Original improvement IDs (P3.1, P4.2, etc.) are preserved in spec.md for traceability

## Documentation

- **[spec.md](./spec.md)** - Complete feature specification
  - 6 prioritized user stories (P1-P6)
  - 21 functional requirements (FR-001 through FR-021)
  - 21 measurable success criteria (SC-001 through SC-021)
  - Comprehensive edge cases

- **[checklists/requirements.md](./checklists/requirements.md)** - Specification validation (✅ All passed)

## Improvements Included

### Priority 1: Debugging Build Failures (~45 min)
**User Story 1** - Observability & Error Handling
- P3.1: Add Logging for Failed Downloads
- P3.2: Add Summary Statistics After Build
- P3.3: Validate Downloaded Images

### Priority 2: Confident Code Changes (~4-5 hours)
**User Story 2** - Automated Testing
- P5.1: Add Unit Tests for Core Functions
- P5.2: Add Integration Test for Full Pipeline
- P5.3: Add Data Validation Script

### Priority 3: Easier Configuration (~4-5 hours)
**User Story 3** - Code Quality & Configuration
- P4.1: Extract Device Selection to Shared Utility
- P4.2: Add Type Hints Throughout
- P4.3: Make Image Preference Configurable
- P6.1: Add YAML Configuration File Support

### Priority 4: Resumable & Reproducible (~2-3 hours)
**User Story 4** - Build Reliability
- P6.2: Complete Resume/Incremental Build Support
- P8.1: Pin CLIP Commit in Conda Environments
- P8.2: Add Conda Lock Files

### Priority 5: Better Documentation (~1.5 hours)
**User Story 5** - Onboarding & Support
- P7.1: Add Troubleshooting Section to README
- P7.2: Add Performance Benchmarks

### Priority 6: Advanced Workflows (~7-11 hours)
**User Story 6** - Developer Experience
- P9.1: Docker Support
- P9.2: Pre-commit Hooks
- P9.3: Embedding Quality Metrics
- P9.4: Incremental Update Support

## Total Effort

**Estimated**: 18-25 hours across all improvements

**Can be implemented incrementally** - Each user story is independently testable and delivers standalone value.

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP Approach (Implement P1-P2 first)
1. **User Story 1**: Observability (~45 min) - Production readiness
2. **User Story 2**: Testing (~4-5 hours) - Confidence in changes

**Result**: Production-ready package with debugging capabilities and test coverage

### Full Implementation (All User Stories)
1. Complete US1-US2 (MVP)
2. Add US3: Configuration & Code Quality (~4-5 hours)
3. Add US4: Reproducibility (~2-3 hours)
4. Add US5: Documentation (~1.5 hours)
5. Add US6: Advanced Features (~7-11 hours) - Optional

## Next Steps

1. **Generate implementation plan**:
   ```bash
   /speckit.plan
   ```

2. **Generate tasks**:
   ```bash
   /speckit.tasks
   ```

3. **Implement** (can do incrementally by user story):
   ```bash
   /speckit.implement
   ```

4. **Mark improvements as complete** in `packages/mtg-image-db/IMPROVEMENTS.md`

## Success Criteria Highlights

- 100% of download failures logged with actionable errors
- >80% code coverage for core functions
- mypy strict mode passes with 0 errors
- All CLI parameters configurable via YAML
- Interrupted builds resume without re-processing >90% of work
- Troubleshooting section covers 10+ common issues
- Docker build works on systems without Conda
