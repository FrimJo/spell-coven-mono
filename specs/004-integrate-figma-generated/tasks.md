# Tasks: Integrate Figma UI into Web Application

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/004-integrate-figma-generated/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md ‚úÖ, spec.md ‚úÖ, research.md ‚úÖ, data-model.md ‚úÖ, contracts/ ‚úÖ

**Tests**: Not requested in specification - tasks focus on implementation only

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Monorepo structure**: `apps/web/`, `packages/ui/`
- **Source**: `apps/web/src/`, `packages/ui/src/`
- **Tests**: `apps/web/tests/`

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and package structure

- [ ] T001 [P] Create `packages/ui` directory structure with `src/{components,lib}`, `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `tailwind.config.ts`
- [ ] T002 [P] Initialize `packages/ui/package.json` with name `@repo/ui`, exports configuration, and peer dependencies (React 19)
- [ ] T003 [P] Configure `packages/ui/tsconfig.json` extending `@repo/typescript-config/react-library.json`
- [ ] T004 [P] Configure `packages/ui/tailwind.config.ts` with content paths and Figma design tokens (slate-950 color)
- [ ] T005 Install TanStack Router dependencies in `apps/web`: `@tanstack/react-router`, `@tanstack/router-plugin`, `react-error-boundary`
- [ ] T006 Remove `next-themes` dependency from `apps/web/package.json`
- [ ] T007 [P] Create `apps/web/src/routes` directory for TanStack Router file-based routing
- [ ] T008 [P] Create `apps/web/src/lib` directory for utilities (session storage, etc.)

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [ ] T009 Configure Vite with TanStack Router plugin in `apps/web/vite.config.ts` (routesDirectory: './src/routes', generatedRouteTree: './src/routeTree.gen.ts')
- [ ] T010 [P] Add path aliases to `apps/web/vite.config.ts` for `@/*` ‚Üí `./src/*` and `@repo/ui/*` ‚Üí `../../packages/ui/src/*`
- [ ] T011 [P] Update `apps/web/tsconfig.json` with path mappings and include `src/routeTree.gen.ts`
- [ ] T012 [P] Update `apps/web/tailwind.config.ts` to include `packages/ui/src/**/*.{ts,tsx}` in content paths
- [ ] T013 Implement session storage utility in `apps/web/src/lib/session-storage.ts` with `saveGameState`, `loadGameState`, `clearGameState` functions and validation
- [ ] T014 [P] Create utility functions in `packages/ui/src/lib/utils.ts` (cn() helper for Tailwind class merging)
- [ ] T015 [P] Create barrel export file `packages/ui/src/index.ts` for component exports
- [ ] T016 Move existing routes to `apps/web/src/routes/prev/` directory to preserve them

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Access Game Interface (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP

**Goal**: Enable users to navigate between landing page and game room with TanStack Router, session storage persistence, and error boundaries

**Independent Test**: Navigate to root URL ‚Üí see landing page ‚Üí create/join game ‚Üí navigate to game room ‚Üí leave game ‚Üí return to landing page. Verify browser back/forward navigation works without page refreshes.

### Implementation for User Story 1

#### Core Routing Infrastructure

- [ ] T020 [US1] Update `apps/web/src/main.tsx` to use TanStack Router with RouterProvider and generated route tree

#### Session Storage Integration

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Story 1 should be fully functional - users can navigate between landing page and game room with session persistence

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Use Shared UI Components (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Migrate used shadcn/ui components to shared package with Tailwind CSS styling, ensuring consistent design across the application

**Independent Test**: Verify all UI components render with correct Tailwind styling, are interactive (buttons click, dialogs open/close), maintain consistent design patterns, and are reusable via `@repo/ui` imports

### Identify Used Components

- [ ] T048 [P] [US2] Migrate Toast/Sonner integration (if used) from `code_from_figma_make/src/components/ui/` to `packages/ui/src/components/`

### Tailwind Styling Verification

- [ ] T056 [US2] Merge other UI dependencies (class-variance-authority, clsx, tailwind-merge, lucide-react) to `packages/ui/package.json`
- [ ] T057 [US2] Verify no duplicate dependencies exist between `apps/web` and `packages/ui`

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Stories 1 AND 2 should both work - UI components are properly styled and reusable from shared package

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Interact with Game Features (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Migrate all game-specific feature components (CardScanner, GameBoard, PlayerStats, VideoPanel, TurnTracker) to enable complete gameplay experience

**Independent Test**: Enter game room ‚Üí verify all game features (scanner, board, stats, video, turns) are visible and accessible ‚Üí interact with each feature ‚Üí verify functionality works as expected

### Migrate Game Feature Components

- [ ] T072 [US3] Verify all game feature components build successfully with migrated dependencies

**Checkpoint**: All user stories should now be independently functional - complete game experience is available

---

## Phase 6: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Cleanup, optimization, and final verification

### Cleanup

- [ ] T073 Delete `code_from_figma_make/` directory after verifying all components are migrated

- [ ] T086 Test join game flow (enter name and ID ‚Üí join ‚Üí navigate to game room)
- [ ] T087 Test leave game flow (click leave ‚Üí navigate to landing page)
- [ ] T088 Test session persistence (create game ‚Üí refresh page ‚Üí verify still in game room)
- [ ] T089 Test browser navigation (back/forward buttons work without page refreshes)
- [ ] T090 Test error boundaries (trigger error ‚Üí verify fallback displays ‚Üí verify recovery works)
- [ ] T091 Test all UI components are styled correctly with Tailwind
- [ ] T092 Test responsive design on mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports
- [ ] T093 Test all game feature components render and are interactive

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

**Minimum Viable Product**: Implement only Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3 (User Story 1)

**Delivers**:
- Basic routing between landing page and game room
- Session storage persistence
- Error boundaries
- Functional UI (even if not fully styled)

**Estimated Effort**: ~4-6 hours

**Value**: Users can navigate the application and create/join games

### Incremental Delivery

**Iteration 1** (MVP): Phase 1 + Phase 2 + Phase 3 (US1)
- Deploy: Basic routing works

**Iteration 2**: Add Phase 4 (US2)
- Deploy: Professional UI with shared components

**Iteration 3**: Add Phase 5 (US3)
- Deploy: Complete game experience

**Iteration 4**: Phase 6 (Polish)
- Deploy: Production-ready

### Parallel Development

If multiple developers available:
- **Developer 1**: Phase 3 (US1 - Routing & core components)
- **Developer 2**: Phase 4 (US2 - UI component migration)
- **Developer 3**: Phase 5 (US3 - Game feature components)

All can work in parallel after Phase 2 (Foundational) is complete.
