# Specification Quality Checklist: Card Recognition via Webcam

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-13
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

✅ **All checklist items passed**

The specification is complete and ready for the planning phase (`/speckit.plan`).

## Notes

- Specification successfully extracted user-facing requirements from existing technical SPEC.md files
- Three prioritized user stories provide clear MVP path (P1 → P2 → P3)
- Success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic
- Edge cases comprehensively cover failure scenarios
- Ready to proceed with technical planning and migration of implementation details
