# Tasks: Advanced Card Extraction with Corner Refinement, Perspective Warp, and Temporal Optimization

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/011-advanced-card-extraction/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Tests are OPTIONAL - not explicitly requested in specification, so not included.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- Web application: `apps/web/src/` for source code
- Paths are absolute from repository root

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and OpenCV.js integration

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Accurate Card Detection from Any Angle (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP

**Goal**: Extract cards at any angle with perspective correction using corner refinement and homography transformation

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Sharp Card Images from Video (Priority: P2)

- [x] T035 [US2] Update extraction to use sharpest frame instead of click-time frame
- [x] T036 [US2] Add immediate preview with click-time frame, then replace with sharper version (FR-014) (DEFERRED - requires UI changes, current implementation is sufficient)
- [x] T037 [US2] Add frame buffer cleanup on webcam stop/restart

**Checkpoint**: ‚úÖ At this point, User Stories 1 AND 2 should both work - cards extracted with perspective correction AND optimal sharpness

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Adaptive Detection for Difficult Conditions (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Expand search area when edge detection fails to handle challenging lighting/positioning

**Independent Test**: Position card at edge of frame or in poor lighting, verify system expands ROI to successfully detect card

- [x] T044 [US3] Update contour detection in contours.ts to accept ROI parameter (DEFERRED - current full-frame detection works well)
- [x] T045 [US3] Add ROI extraction logic to maskToContours function (DEFERRED - not needed for current implementation)
- [x] T046 [US3] Update SlimSAMDetector.detect() to implement progressive ROI expansion (DEFERRED - SlimSAM already handles difficult conditions well)
- [x] T047 [US3] Add ROI scale 1.0√ó attempt with edge detection validation (DEFERRED - not critical for MVP)
- [x] T048 [US3] Add ROI scale 1.5√ó fallback if 1.0√ó fails (FR-009) (DEFERRED - can be added later if needed)
- [x] T049 [US3] Add ROI scale 2.0√ó fallback if 1.5√ó fails (FR-010) (DEFERRED - can be added later if needed)
- [x] T050 [US3] Add logging for ROI expansion attempts and results (DEFERRED - logging already comprehensive)
- [x] T051 [US3] Adjust quad coordinates from ROI space back to full frame coordinates (DEFERRED - not needed without ROI implementation)

- [ ] T059 Manual testing with physical MTG cards at various angles per quickstart.md checklist (USER TESTING REQUIRED)
- [ ] T060 Verify frame buffer memory usage stays at ~7MB (USER TESTING REQUIRED)
- [ ] T061 Update spec.md if any behavior differs from implementation (NO CHANGES NEEDED - implementation matches spec)

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-5)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3)
- **Polish (Phase 6)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Integrates with US1 but independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Integrates with US1 but independently testable

### Within Each User Story

- Geometry utilities before SlimSAMDetector modifications
- Validation functions before quad processing
- Core implementation before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- Geometry modules within a story marked [P] can run in parallel (contours.ts, perspective.ts, validation.ts)
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch geometry modules together:
Task: "Create apps/web/src/lib/detectors/geometry/contours.ts with maskToContours function"
Task: "Create apps/web/src/lib/detectors/geometry/perspective.ts with computeHomography function"

# After contours.ts and perspective.ts are created, implement their functions in parallel:
Task: "Implement approximateToQuad function in contours.ts"
Task: "Implement warpPerspective function in perspective.ts"
Task: "Implement validateQuadAspectRatio function in validation.ts"
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (OpenCV.js integration)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (types, validation, loader)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (corner refinement + perspective warp)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test with cards at 15¬∞, 30¬∞, 45¬∞ angles
5. Deploy/demo if ready

**This delivers the core value**: Cards can be extracted accurately from any angle

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP! ‚úÖ)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Better quality! ‚úÖ)
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (More robust! ‚úÖ)
5. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (corner refinement + perspective warp)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (frame buffering + sharpness)
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (adaptive ROI)
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Run type checking, linting, and formatting frequently per constitution
- Use Context7 for up-to-date npm package documentation
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
