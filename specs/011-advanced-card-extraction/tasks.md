# Tasks: Advanced Card Extraction with Corner Refinement, Perspective Warp, and Temporal Optimization

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/011-advanced-card-extraction/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Tests are OPTIONAL - not explicitly requested in specification, so not included.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- Web application: `apps/web/src/` for source code
- Paths are absolute from repository root

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-5)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3)
- **Polish (Phase 6)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Integrates with US1 but independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Integrates with US1 but independently testable

### Within Each User Story

- Geometry utilities before SlimSAMDetector modifications
- Validation functions before quad processing
- Core implementation before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- Geometry modules within a story marked [P] can run in parallel (contours.ts, perspective.ts, validation.ts)
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch geometry modules together:
Task: "Create apps/web/src/lib/detectors/geometry/contours.ts with maskToContours function"
Task: "Create apps/web/src/lib/detectors/geometry/perspective.ts with computeHomography function"

# After contours.ts and perspective.ts are created, implement their functions in parallel:
Task: "Implement approximateToQuad function in contours.ts"
Task: "Implement warpPerspective function in perspective.ts"
Task: "Implement validateQuadAspectRatio function in validation.ts"
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (OpenCV.js integration)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (types, validation, loader)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (corner refinement + perspective warp)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test with cards at 15¬∞, 30¬∞, 45¬∞ angles
5. Deploy/demo if ready

**This delivers the core value**: Cards can be extracted accurately from any angle

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP! ‚úÖ)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Better quality! ‚úÖ)
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (More robust! ‚úÖ)
5. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (corner refinement + perspective warp)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (frame buffering + sharpness)
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (adaptive ROI)
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Run type checking, linting, and formatting frequently per constitution
- Use Context7 for up-to-date npm package documentation
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
