# Specification Quality Checklist: Advanced Card Extraction

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-16  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

✅ **All checklist items pass**

### Detailed Review:

**Content Quality**: 
- Specification focuses on WHAT (corner refinement, perspective correction, frame selection) without specifying HOW
- Written for product stakeholders - describes user value and outcomes
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

**Requirement Completeness**:
- All 14 functional requirements are testable and specific
- Success criteria are measurable (e.g., "45° angle", "2% distortion", "70% of cases")
- Acceptance scenarios use Given/When/Then format
- Edge cases cover occlusion, lighting, multiple cards, etc.
- Dependencies and assumptions clearly listed

**Feature Readiness**:
- Each user story has clear acceptance criteria
- Three prioritized user stories (P1-P3) cover the feature scope
- Success criteria align with user stories
- No implementation leakage (mentions OpenCV.js only in Assumptions/Dependencies section, not in requirements)

## Notes

**Clarification Session Completed (2025-10-16)**:
- ✅ Partial occlusion behavior defined (attempt extraction, fail gracefully)
- ✅ Frame buffer size specified (6 frames)
- ✅ Output dimensions clarified (384×384 pixels)
- ✅ FR-015 added for occlusion handling
- ✅ FR-005, FR-012 updated with specific values

Specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` phase.
