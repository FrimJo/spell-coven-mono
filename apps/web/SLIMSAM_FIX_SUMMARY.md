# SlimSAM Detector Fix Summary

## Issues Found

### 1. **Incorrect Model ID** (Primary Issue)
- **Problem**: Using `Xenova/slimsam` which returned 401 Unauthorized errors
- **Root Cause**: The model ID was incorrect - it doesn't exist or requires authentication
- **Solution**: Changed to `Xenova/slimsam-77-uniform` which is the correct public model

### 2. **Wrong API Usage** (Critical Issue)
- **Problem**: Using `pipeline('image-segmentation', ...)` which threw "Unsupported model type: sam"
- **Root Cause**: SAM models in transformers.js v3.7.5 don't work with the pipeline API
- **Solution**: Changed to direct model loading using `SamModel.from_pretrained()` and `AutoProcessor.from_pretrained()`

## Changes Made

### File: `apps/web/src/lib/detectors/factory.ts`
```typescript
// Changed from:
modelId: 'Xenova/slimsam'

// To:
modelId: 'Xenova/slimsam-77-uniform'
```

### File: `apps/web/src/lib/detectors/slimsam-detector.ts`

#### 1. Updated Imports
```typescript
// Changed from:
import { env, pipeline } from '@huggingface/transformers'

// To:
import { env, SamModel, AutoProcessor, RawImage } from '@huggingface/transformers'
```

#### 2. Changed Model Loading
```typescript
// OLD (pipeline API):
this.segmenter = await pipeline('image-segmentation', modelId, {...})

// NEW (direct model loading):
this.model = await SamModel.from_pretrained(modelId, {...})
this.processor = await AutoProcessor.from_pretrained(modelId, {...})
```

#### 3. Updated Detection Method
```typescript
// OLD:
const result = await this.segmenter(canvas, {
  points: [[point.x, point.y]],
  labels: [1]
})

// NEW:
const image = await RawImage.fromCanvas(canvas)
const inputs = await this.processor(image, {
  input_points: [[[point.x, point.y]]],
  input_labels: [[1]],
})
const outputs = await this.model(inputs)
```

#### 4. Added Fallback Models
```typescript
const FALLBACK_MODELS = [
  'Xenova/slimsam-77-uniform',
  'Xenova/slimsam-50-uniform',
]
```

### File: `apps/web/src/lib/webcam.ts`
- Added automatic fallback to DETR detector if SlimSAM fails with authentication errors
- Enhanced error handling with user-friendly messages

### File: `apps/web/src/hooks/useWebcam.ts`
- Added `onProgress` callback to display detector initialization status to users

## Result

✅ **SlimSAM detector now initializes successfully**
- Model loads: `Xenova/slimsam-77-uniform`
- No more 401 errors
- No more "Unsupported model type" errors
- Proper progress feedback to users

## Additional Improvements

1. **Retry Logic**: Added retry mechanism with configurable attempts
2. **Error Handling**: Better error messages and structured logging
3. **Graceful Degradation**: Automatic fallback to DETR if SlimSAM fails
4. **Progress Feedback**: Users see loading status during model initialization

## Testing

The fix was verified on `http://localhost:3000/game/game-elymc5m1q`:
- ✅ No console errors
- ✅ SlimSAM loads successfully
- ✅ Page renders correctly
- ✅ Camera functionality available

## Notes

- The ONNX Runtime warnings about MatMul operations are normal and don't affect functionality
- SlimSAM-77 is the 77% pruned version (smaller, faster)
- SlimSAM-50 is available as a fallback (50% pruned, more accurate but larger)
